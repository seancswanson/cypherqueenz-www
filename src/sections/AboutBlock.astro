            ... after many years of seeing a need for more community for Bgirls.
            We give props to all the Bgirls who have been holding it down for a
            long time, but have observed many women briefly coming into the
            scene and then quickly leaving because of lack of support. There is
            an explosion of talented Bgirls all over the world now and there is
            so much more to come. In Seattle, we want to provide that space for
            them.
